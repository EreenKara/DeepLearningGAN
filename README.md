Generative Adversarial Networks project. From Photograph to Comic using Pix2PixGAN. 

# Learning PRocess
I didn't want to implement a deep learning model which i didn't know so I have looked at different GAN or Deep Learning Models. After all this literature review, I finally understand what is going on in deep learning and what is used for those lines, how I can give my pictures to model etc. 
I started with a Fashion Gan model training using MNIST dataset.
GAN is a deep learning model that goals to create a picture which is looks like given dataset but a totally new picture. Two deep learning model fighting in this model and we want generator to win.
### DATASET (MNIST)

### After a few epochs. It is doing bad.

### And final form, it is done. It can create new pictures that looks like MNIST but it is not MNIST.
